A GenAI Assistant for Adobe's Digital Certificate Website

Adobe’s Digital Experience (DX) Platform has an important, ambitious goal of making knowledge accessible and empowering learners by offering high-demand industry-relevant skills to students and professionals alike.  With an extensive portfolio of more than 52 certifications and 23 courses alongside supplemental resources, the platform offers something for everyone. However, to truly reach and benefit everyone - professionals, students, career changers, and lifelong learners alike - the platform must deliver a seamless and personalized user experience that helps each individual see how Adobe’s offerings can empower them to achieve their unique goals. To accomplish this, we must address several inherent challenges.

Key Challenges:

- The current platform needs to adequately guide users to identify the products that are right for them, rather than relying on users to explore the plethora of options manually 

- As Adobe continues to expand its offerings with new products, certifications, and courses, the current system must evolve to scale efficiently

- The platform needs a tailored approach to create learning trajectories, making it easier for users to connect offerings to their aspirations

- The platform should foster inclusivity and engagement by recommending resources that align with a student’s diverse intellectual background and current knowledge
